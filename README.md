MyMultiMusic2
=============

***A work in progress*** 

This app takes advantage of the WiFi Direct feature on Android phones version 4.0 and above. 

It creates a direct connection between two Android devices to allow for high speed communication, which allows the two
devices to play music synchronously, as well as send each other .mp3 files at high speed.
